# ZLibrary Downloader Refactoring

## Overview
The `downloadFiles.py` has been refactored to reduce implementation complexity while maintaining the same functionality and preparing for future proxy pool integration.

## Key Changes

### 1. Class-Based Architecture
- **Before**: Multiple standalone functions scattered throughout the file
- **After**: Single `ZLibraryDownloader` class that encapsulates all functionality
- **Benefits**: Better organization, easier testing, and cleaner interfaces

### 2. Simplified Function Structure
- **Merged Functions**: 
  - `load_cookies()` → `_load_cookies()` (private method)
  - `validate_session()` + `regenerate_cookies()` → `_validate_and_refresh_session()`
  - `download_file()` → `_download_file()` (simplified retry logic)
  - `random_delay()` → integrated into main download loop

### 3. Reduced Code Complexity
- **Lines of Code**: Reduced from ~291 to ~218 lines (25% reduction)
- **Functions**: Reduced from 6 standalone functions to 1 class with 6 methods
- **Eliminated**: Redundant header definitions, scattered configurations, duplicate error handling

### 4. Future Proxy Pool Support
- **Structure**: Added `proxy_pool` parameter in constructor
- **Method**: `_get_connector()` method ready for proxy integration
- **Example**: Created `proxy_example.py` showing how to implement proxy rotation

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)
```python
import asyncio
from downloadFiles import download_books

# Same as before
await download_books("books.json", "downloads")
```

### New Class-Based Usage
```python
from downloadFiles import ZLibraryDownloader

# Basic usage
downloader = ZLibraryDownloader()
await downloader.download_books("books.json", "downloads")

# With custom cookies file
downloader = ZLibraryDownloader(cookies_file="custom_cookies.pkl")
await downloader.download_books("books.json", "downloads")

# With future proxy pool
proxy_pool = ProxyPool(["http://proxy1:8080", "http://proxy2:8080"])
downloader = ZLibraryDownloader(proxy_pool=proxy_pool)
await downloader.download_books("books.json", "downloads")
```

## Maintained Features
- ✅ Cookie authentication and auto-regeneration
- ✅ User agent rotation
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ File validation (HTML detection)
- ✅ Progress tracking and error reporting
- ✅ Rate limiting between downloads
- ✅ SSL error handling

## Future Proxy Pool Implementation
The code is structured to easily add proxy support by:

1. Implementing a `ProxyPool` class with methods:
   - `get_proxy()` - Return next available proxy
   - `remove_proxy()` - Remove failing proxy
   - `add_proxy()` - Add new proxy to pool

2. Modifying `_get_connector()` to use `aiohttp.ProxyConnector`

3. Adding proxy rotation logic in the download loop

## Benefits of Refactoring
1. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Class methods can be easily unit tested
3. **Extensibility**: Ready for proxy pool and other features
4. **Reliability**: Simplified error handling reduces bugs
5. **Performance**: Reduced overhead from eliminated redundancy
